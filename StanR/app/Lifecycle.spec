Scenario Heading
----------------

Where might I use these components in applications every day? How are they used?
What data is needed to comprise the content of these applications?
Which pieces of that data are static? Which pieces are dynamic?
What is the relational layout of each of the components? How would you accomplish this? What constraints would be required?

How many distinct features do the applications you use have?
How are they arranged?
What might the navigation graph look like for these applications?
How do you, the user, navigate to and from each feature?
What navigation methods are present?
Do they work well with the hardware navigation?
Have you ever felt abandoned or unable to get where you want to go?
Are other applications a part of the experience? Browser, Camera, etc.

A true understanding of the Android lifecycle is paramount to any Android developer. Understanding
code placement, object initialization, and functionality in regards to the lifecycle will increase
your app stability and performance. Think about your application - what information will need to
persist through device orientation changes or the app is placed in the background? What views need
to be initialized and referenced? Are there other considerations to take into account when
structuring your code?

What happens if you’re typing in a form and take a call?
When you return is the content still there?
Think about watching a video in an app, what happens if you switch focus to a notification?

For the various features, what data is required to be displayed to the user?
Do the features require multiple states? (Think about a social media app with the ability to edit or comment on the post.)
What logic is required to make these features functional? Which layer do you think that logic would reside?
Are there any long running tasks that persist when the application is in the background?
Does the data update while you’re using the app? Do you have to do anything to make that change?
